# Accessing Elements of Lists

# Python starts its lists at 0
animals = ['bear', 'tiger', 'penguin', 'zebra']
# bear = animals[0]
print(animals[1])

# We call these kinds of numbers "ordinal" numbers, because they indicate an ordering of things.
# Programmers, however, can't think this way because they can pick any element out of a list at any point.
# To programmers, the list of animals is more like a deck of cards. If they want the tiger, they grab it.
# This kind of number is a "cardinal" number and means you can pick at random, so there needs to be a 0 element.

# With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers,
# can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009?
# (Hint: you can't pick years at random.)

# Remember: ordinal == ordered, 1st; cardinal == cards at random, 0.

And you are like the word: MelancholyA butterfly of dream
You are like my soul
Filled with my soul
You emerge from the things
As all things are filled with my soul
And it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
It seems as though your eyes had flown away
And my voice does not touch you
And you hear me from far away
It is as though you are absent
I like for you to be still

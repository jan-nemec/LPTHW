# Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters
"""Comments and Pound Characters"""

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.")  # and the comment after ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")
print("Hi # there.")

# Good Comments
# * Describe why you are doing what you are doing. The code already says
#   how, but why you did things the way you did is more important.
# * While comments are good, too many are bad, and you have to maintain them.
#   Keep your comments relatively short and to the point, and if you change aÂ¨
#   function, review the comment to make sure it's still correct.

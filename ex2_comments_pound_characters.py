# Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters
"""Comments and Pound Characters"""

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.")  # and the comment after ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print("This won't run.")

# This is block comment.

print("This will run.")  # This is an in-line comment.
print("Hi # there.")

# PEP8 recommends at least two spaces between the code and the # symbol.

# Good Comments
# * Describe why you are doing what you are doing. The code already says
#   how, but why you did things the way you did is more important.
# * While comments are good, too many are bad, and you have to maintain them.
#   Keep your comments relatively short and to the point, and if you change aÂ¨
#   function, review the comment to make sure it's still correct.

# * Comments are best used to clarify code that may not be easy to understand,
#   or to explain why something is done a certain way.

# * PEP8 recommends that comments be used sparingly. Use comments only when
#   they add value to your code by making it easier to understand why something
#   is done a certain way.

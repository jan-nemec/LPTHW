# Boolean Practice

# 1. Find an equality test (== or !=) and replace it with its truth.
# 2. Find each and/or inside parentheses and solve those first.
# 3. Find each not and invert it.
# 4. Find any remaining and/or and solve it.
# 5. When you are done you should have True or False.

# Python and many languages like to return one of the operands to 
# their Boolean expressions rather than just True or False. 
# This means that if you did False and 1 you get the first operand (False), 
# but if you do True and 1 you get the second (1). 

# Is there any difference between != and <>? 
# Python has deprecated <> in favor of !=, so use !=.

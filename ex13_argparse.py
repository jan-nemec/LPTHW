# argparse is the “recommended command-line parsing module in the Python standard library.” 
# It’s what you use to get command line arguments into your program.
# Using argparse is how you let the user of your program provide values for
# variables at runtime. It’s a means of communication between the writer of a program and the user.
# Giving the user the ability to enter command line arguments provides flexibility.

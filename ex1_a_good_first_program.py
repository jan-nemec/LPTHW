# Source Code Endcoding
# By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8.
# To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line 
# should be added as the FIRST line of the file. The syntax is as follows:
# -*- coding: encoding -*-
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
# One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with 
# a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case, the encoding declaration should be 
# added as the second line of the file. For example:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

# Exercise 1: A Good First Program
"""A Good First Program"""

print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Again")
print("I like typing this.")
# print("This is fun.")
# print('Yah! printing')
# print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
# print('I "said" do not touch this.')
print("I made the study drill.")

# Code Style
# * If you can't read the code out loud, it's probably hart to read. If you
#   are having a problem making easy to use, try reading loud. Not only does
#   this force you to slow down and really read it, but it also helps you find
#   difficult passages and things to change the readability.
# * Try to do what other people are doing in Python until you find your own
#   style.

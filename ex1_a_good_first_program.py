# Exercise 1: A Good First Program
"""A Good First Program"""

print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Again")
print("I like typing this.")
# print("This is fun.")
# print('Yah! printing')
# print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
# print('I "said" do not touch this.')
print("I made the study drill.")

# Code Style
# * If you can't read the code out loud, it's probably hart to read. If you
#   are having a problem making easy to use, try reading loud. Not only does
#   this force you to slow down and really read it, but it also helps you find
#   difficult passages and things to change the readability.
# * Try to do what other people are doing in Python until you find your own
#   style.

# Interpreter
# Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must
# type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
